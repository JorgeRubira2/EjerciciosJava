    <h1>Menhirs of Lavajo</h1>
    <p>The <b>Menhirs of Lavajo</b> (<i>Portuguese: Menires de Lavajo</i>) are a group of menhirs, located in the civil parish of Alcoutim e Pereiro in the municipality of Alcoutim, Portuguese Algarve. Someone else will have to code this please! The site is 1,200 km From village with decimal , that is 1200 meters. Not 750 miles. Well signposted from the main highway IC 27</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><u>These structures are territorial</u> marks or define sacred spaces from the Late Neolithic or Chalcolithic period (constructed sometime between 3500 and 2800 B.C.).[1]

        The first excavations in 1998, revealed the existence of not only the large menhir, but fragments of the two small menhirs.[1] These menhirs raised the possibility that the group was an intentional alignment of these structures.[1] One of these structures were eventually stored in the archaeological museum in Alcoutim.[1]</p>
